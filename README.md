# Transformer for Neural Language Processing

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has revolutionized NLP by enabling models to process entire sequences of words in parallel, leading to significant improvements in performance and efficiency.

## Features

- *Attention Mechanism:* Implements self-attention and multi-head attention to capture relationships between all words in a sequence.
- *Encoder-Decoder Architecture:* Consists of stacked encoders and decoders that transform input sequences into meaningful representations for various NLP tasks.
- *Positional Encoding:* Adds positional information to input embeddings to retain the order of words.
- *Scalability:* Efficiently handles long sequences and large datasets, suitable for training on modern GPUs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

bash
git clone https://github.com/omsinghindia/Attention_Mechanism.git
cd Attention_Mechanism
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Training

Train the Transformer model on a dataset:

python
from transformer import Transformer
from dataset import load_data

# Load your data
train_data, val_data = load_data('path_to_your_dataset')

# Initialize the model
model = Transformer(
    num_layers=6,
    d_model=512,
    num_heads=8,
    dff=2048,
    input_vocab_size=8500,
    target_vocab_size=8000,
    pe_input=10000,
    pe_target=6000,
    rate=0.1
)

# Train the model
model.train(train_data, val_data, epochs=20, batch_size=64)


### Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model:

python
# Load a pre-trained model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('path_to_model.pth'))

# Evaluate on validation data
model.evaluate(val_data)


### Inference

Use the model for inference:

python
# Translate a new sentence
input_sentence = "your input sentence here"
output_sentence = model.translate(input_sentence)
print(output_sentence)


## Attention Mechanism

The core innovation of the Transformer is the attention mechanism, specifically the self-attention and multi-head attention components.

### Self-Attention

Self-attention allows each word in a sentence to focus on other words in the sentence when constructing its representation. This mechanism helps the model understand the context of a word by considering the entire sequence.

### Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention extends self-attention by using multiple attention heads. Each head operates in a different subspace of the input, capturing diverse aspects of the relationships between words. The outputs of all heads are concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output.

### Positional Encoding

Since the Transformer does not have a built-in sense of order (like RNNs or CNNs), positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the relative position of words in the sequence.

## Implementation Details

- *Encoder:* Each encoder layer consists of a multi-head attention mechanism followed by a position-wise feed-forward network. Residual connections and layer normalization are applied after each sub-layer.
- *Decoder:* The decoder layers are similar to the encoder but include an additional multi-head attention mechanism to attend to the encoder's output.
- *Training Loop:* The training process involves minimizing the loss function, which is typically the cross-entropy loss for sequence-to-sequence tasks. The model parameters are updated using an optimizer such as Adam.
